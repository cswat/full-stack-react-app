# Full stack React app with REST API

This applications allows the user to read and, if they're an authorized user, write to a school database that manages courses.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting the app

You'll want to open two terminal windows.

In the first:
* cd to the api directory
* run npm start (or npm run dev)
* this loads up the api middleware that manages all the transactions
* keep this window open

In the second:
* cd to the client directory
* run npm start
* this will open a window in localhost:3000 with the app
* also keep this window open
